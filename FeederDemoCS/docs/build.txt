Demo code built and ran, despite VS warnings:

Severity	Code	Description	Project	File	Line	Suppression State
Warning		There was a mismatch between the processor architecture of the project being built "MSIL" and the processor architecture of the reference
                "vJoyInterfaceWrap, Version=0.2.0.5, Culture=neutral, processorArchitecture=MSIL", "AMD64".
                This mismatch may cause runtime failures. Please consider changing the targeted processor architecture of your project
                through the Configuration Manager so as to align the processor architectures between your project and references,
                or take a dependency on references with a processor architecture that matches the targeted processor architecture of your project.	FeederDemoCS
